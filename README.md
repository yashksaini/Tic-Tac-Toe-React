## About the Project

The Tic Tac Toe Game is a digital version of the timeless game. Built using React and CSS, this project showcases the power of component-based development. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
